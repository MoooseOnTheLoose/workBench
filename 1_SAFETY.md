# SAFETY.md

## Purpose

This repository (`_workBench_`) contains educational and experimental tools intended for:

- learning how networks, protocols, and systems behave  
- personal network diagnostics and testing  
- controlled experimentation in preparation for future internal tooling or services  

All content is maintained for legitimate, professional, and self-directed use.

---

## Intended Use

Tools in this repository are meant to be used only:

- on systems you own or fully control  
- on personal or lab networks  
- in isolated test environments (VMs, containers, or sandboxed hosts)  

The goal is understanding, diagnostics, and skill development — not deployment or automation on live systems.

---

## Boundaries

- This repository is not a production system.  
- Tools here are not intended to be run on hardened devices, appliances, or monitoring systems.  
- Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as authorization to access or test external networks or third-party systems.

---

## Professional Use Statement

Some tools demonstrate low-level system or network behavior that may also appear in security research contexts.  
They are included strictly for educational clarity, personal diagnostics, and technical exploration.

Usage is expected to follow applicable laws, ethical guidelines, and responsible computing practices.

---

## Relationship to Other Projects

This repository is intentionally separate from:

- production software  
- monitoring or surveillance systems  
- evidence, logging, or compliance tooling  

Any future integration into a unified service will require explicit design, safety review, and scope control.
